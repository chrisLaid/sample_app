<h2>The Guardian</h2>

<p>As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and
logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal,
concrete fashion.</p>
<p>ESTJ's live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present, with their eye constantly
scanning their personal environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically.
They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of
others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value these systems. They value
competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts.</p>
<p>ESTJ’s are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should be, that they
naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at
devising systems and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a
specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such strongly held
beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their
standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely straight-
forward and honest.</p>
<p>The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she takes their commitments
seriously, and follows their own standards of "good citizenship" to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with
people, and likes to have fun. ESTJ’s can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially activities
which are focused on the family, community, or work.</p>
<p>The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become overly detail-oriented. Since
they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs, it's important that they remember to value other people's input
and opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other's needs for
intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which
demand more emotional sensitivity.</p>
<p>When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others. They feel as if they are
misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is
very verbal and doesn't have any problem expressing themselves, when under stress they have a hard time
putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.</p>
<p>ESTJ’s value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do all that they can to enhance
and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owner’s association
meetings, and generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security.
The ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything that they
think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good amount of energy. He or she is
conscientious, practical, realistic, and dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is
important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value the importance
of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such
goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding them and
incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security.</p>
