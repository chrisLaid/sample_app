<h2>The Duty Fulfiller</h2>
<p>As an ISTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in
via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where
you deal with things rationally and logically.</p>
<p>ISTJ's are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful
living. They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends them a serious air
and the motivation to follow through on tasks. Organized and methodical in their
approach, they can generally succeed at any task which they undertake.</p>
<p>ISTJ’s are very loyal, faithful, and dependable. They place great importance on honesty
and integrity. They are "good citizens" who can be depended on to do the right thing for
their families and communities. While they generally take things very seriously, they also
usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - especially at family or
work-related gatherings.</p>
<p>ISTJ’s tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others. They're
not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. If they are able to see a
good reason for stepping outside of the established mode of doing things, the ISTJ will
support that effort. However, ISTJ’s more often tend to believe that things should be done
according to procedures and plans. If an ISTJ has not developed their Intuitive side
sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on doing
everything "by the book".</p>
<p>The ISTJ is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or she has
promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled on them.
Because the ISTJ has such a strong sense of duty, they may have a difficult time saying
"no" when they are given more work than they can reasonably handle. For this reason, the
<p>ISTJ often works long hours, and may be unwittingly taken advantage of.</p>
The ISTJ will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy into
doing any task which they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they will resist
putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a
practical application. They prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the
situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and enjoy being in
positions of authority. The ISTJ has little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the
practical application is clear.</p>
<p>ISTJ’s have tremendous respect for facts. They hold a tremendous store of facts within
themselves, which they have gathered through their Sensing preference. They may havedifficulty understanding a theory or idea which is different from their own perspective.</p>
<p>However, if they are shown the importance or relevance of the idea to someone who they
respect or care about, the idea becomes a fact, which the ISTJ will internalize and
support. Once the ISTJ supports a cause or idea, he or she will stop at no lengths to
ensure that they are doing their duty of giving support where support is needed.</p>
<p>The ISTJ is not naturally in tune with their own feelings and the feelings of others. They
may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately, as they are presented.
Being perfectionists themselves, they have a tendency to take other people's efforts for
granted, like they take their own efforts for granted. They need to remember to pat people
on the back once in a while.</p>
<p>ISTJ’s are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others.
However, their strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any
situation usually allows them to overcome their natural reservations, and they are usually
quite supporting and caring individuals with the people that they love. Once the ISTJ
realizes the emotional needs of those who are close to them, they put forth effort to meet
those needs.</p>
<p>The ISTJ is extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, they will put
forth great amounts of effort at making their homes and families running smoothly. They
are responsible parents, taking their parenting roles seriously. They are usually good and
generous providers to their families. They care deeply about those close to them,
although they usually are not comfortable with expressing their love. The ISTJ is likely to
express their affection through actions, rather than through words.</p>
<p>ISTJ’s have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it, plan it, and
implement it through to completion. They are very hard workers, who do not allow
obstacles to get in the way of performing their duties. They do not usually give
themselves enough credit for their achievements, seeing their accomplishments simply as
the natural fulfillment of their obligations.</p>
<p>ISTJ’s usually have a great sense of space and function, and artistic appreciation. Their
homes are likely to be tastefully furnished and immaculately maintained. They are
acutely aware of their senses, and want to be in surroundings which fit their need for
structure, order, and beauty.</p>
<p>Under stress, ISTJ’s may fall into "catastrophe mode", where they see nothing but all of
the possibilities of what could go wrong. They will berate themselves for things which
they should have done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose
their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and will depress themselves with their
visions of doom.</p>
<p>In general, the ISTJ has a tremendous amount of potential. Capable, logical, reasonable,
and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peacefulliving, the ISTJ has what it takes to be highly effective at achieving their chosen goals -
whatever they may be.</p>
