<h2>The Artist</h2>

<p>As an ISFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your value system.
Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in via your five senses in a
literal, concrete fashion.</p>
<p>ISFP's live in the world of sensation possibilities. They are keenly in tune with the way
things look, taste, sound, feel and smell. They have a strong aesthetic appreciation for art,
and are likely to be artists in some form, because they are unusually gifted at creating and
composing things which will strongly affect the senses. They have a strong set of values,
which they strive to consistently meet in their lives. They need to feel as if they're living
their lives in accordance with what they feel is right, and will rebel against anything
which conflicts with that goal. They're likely to choose jobs and careers which allow
them the freedom of working towards the realization of their value-oriented personal
goals.</p>
<p>ISFP’s tend to be quiet and reserved, and difficult to get to know well. They hold back
their ideas and opinions except from those who they are closest to. They are likely to be
kind, gentle and sensitive in their dealings with others. They are interested in contributing
to people's sense of well-being and happiness, and will put a great deal of effort and
energy into tasks which they believe in.</p>
<p>ISFP’s have a strong affinity for aesthetics and beauty. They're likely to be animal lovers,
and to have a true appreciation for the beauties of nature. They're original and
independent, and need to have personal space. They value people who take the time to
understand the ISFP, and who support the ISFP in pursuing their goals in their own,
unique way. People who don't know them well may see their unique way of life as a sign
of carefree light-heartedness, but the ISFP actually takes life very seriously, constantly
gathering specific information and shifting it through their value systems, in search for
clarification and underlying meaning.</p>
<p>ISFP’s are action-oriented individuals. They are "doers", and are usually uncomfortable
with theorizing concepts and ideas, unless they see a practical application. They learn
best in a "hands-on" environment, and consequently may become easily bored with the
traditional teaching methods, which emphasize abstract thinking. They do not like
impersonal analysis, and are uncomfortable with the idea of making decisions based
strictly on logic. Their strong value systems demand that decisions are evaluated against
their subjective beliefs, rather than against some objective rules or laws.</p> <p>ISFP’s are extremely perceptive and aware of others. They constantly gather specific
information about people, and seek to discover what it means. They are usually
penetratingly accurate in their perceptions of others.</p>
<p>ISFP’s are warm and sympathetic. They genuinely care about people, and are strongly
service-oriented in their desire to please. They have an unusually deep well of caring for
those who are close to them, and are likely to show their love through actions, rather than
words.</p>
<p>ISFP’s have no desire to lead or control others, just as they have no desire to be led or
controlled by others. They need space and time alone to evaluate the circumstances of
their life against their value system, and are likely to respect other people's needs for the
same.</p>
<p>The ISFP is likely to not give themselves enough credit for the things which they do
extremely well. Their strong value systems can lead them to be intensely perfectionist,
and cause them to judge themselves with unnecessary harshness.
The ISFP has many special gifts for the world, especially in the areas of creating artistic
sensation, and selflessly serving others. Life is not likely to be extremely easy for the
ISFP, because they take life so seriously, but they have the tools to make their lives and
the lives of those close to them richly rewarding experiences.</p>
