<h2>The Protector</h2>

<p>As an INFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in primarily via
intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things according to how you feel about
them, or how they fit with your personal value system.</p>
<p>INFJ's are gentle, caring, complex and highly intuitive individuals. Artistic and creative, they live in a
world of hidden meanings and possibilities. Only one percent of the population has an INFJ Personality
Type, making it the rarest of all the types.</p>
<p>INFJ’s place great importance on having things orderly and systematic in their outer world. They put a lot
of energy into identifying the best system for getting things done, and constantly define and re-define the
priorities in their lives. On the other hand, INFJ’s operate within themselves on an intuitive basis which is
entirely spontaneous. They know things intuitively, without being able to pinpoint why, and without
detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. They are usually right, and they usually know it.</p> <p>Consequently,
INFJ’s put a tremendous amount of faith into their instincts and intuitions. This is something of a conflict
between the inner and outer worlds, and may result in the INFJ not being as organized as other Judging
types tend to be. Or we may see some signs of disarray in an otherwise orderly tendency, such as a
consistently messy desk.</p>
<p>INFJ’s have uncanny insight into people and situations. They get "feelings" about things and intuitively
understand them. As an extreme example, some INFJ’s report experiences of a psychic nature, such as
getting strong feelings about there being a problem with a loved one, and discovering later that they were in
a car accident. This is the sort of thing that other types may scorn and scoff at, and the INFJ themselves
does not really understand their intuition at a level which can be verbalized.</p> <p>Consequently, most INFJ’s are
protective of their inner selves, sharing only what they choose to share when they choose to share it. They
are deep, complex individuals, who are quite private and typically difficult to understand. INFJ’s hold back
part of themselves, and can be secretive.
But the INFJ is as genuinely warm as they are complex. INFJ’s hold a special place in the heart of people
who they are close to, who are able to see their special gifts and depth of caring. INFJ’s are concerned for
people's feelings, and try to be gentle to avoid hurting anyone. They are very sensitive to conflict, and
cannot tolerate it very well. Situations which are charged with conflict may drive the normally peaceful
INFJ into a state of agitation or charged anger. They may tend to internalize conflict into their bodies, and
experience health problems when under a lot of stress.</p>
<p>Because the INFJ has such strong intuitive capabilities, they trust their own instincts above all else. This
may result in an INFJ stubbornness and tendency to ignore other people's opinions. They believe that
they're right. On the other hand, INFJ is a perfectionist who doubts that they are living up to their full
potential. INFJ’s are rarely at complete peace with themselves - there's always something else they should
be doing to improve themselves and the world around them. They believe in constant growth, and don't
often take time to revel in their accomplishments. They have strong value systems, and need to live their
lives in accordance with what they feel is right. In deference to the Feeling aspect of their personalities,
INFJ’s are in some ways gentle and easy going. Conversely, they have very high expectations of
themselves, and frequently of their families. They don't believe in compromising their ideals.</p>
<p>INFJ is a natural nurturer; patient, devoted and protective. They make loving parents and usually have
strong bonds with their offspring. They have high expectations of their children, and push them to be thebest that they can be. This can sometimes manifest itself in the INFJ being hard-nosed and stubborn. But
generally, children of an INFJ get devoted and sincere parental guidance, combined with deep caring.</p>
<p>In the workplace, the INFJ usually shows up in areas where they can be creative and somewhat
independent. They have a natural affinity for art, and many excel in the sciences, where they make use of
their intuition. INFJ’s can also be found in service-oriented professions. They are not good at dealing with
minutia or very detailed tasks. The INFJ will either avoid such things, or else go to the other extreme and
become enveloped in the details to the extent that they can no longer see the big picture. An INFJ who has
gone the route of becoming meticulous about details may be highly critical of other individuals who are
not.</p>
<p>
The INFJ individual is gifted in ways that other types are not. Life is not necessarily easy for the INFJ, but
they are capable of great depth of feeling and personal achievement.</p>
