<h2>The Scientist</h2>

<p>As an INTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in
primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things
rationally and logically.</p>
<p>INTJ's live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value intelligence,
knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which
they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser extent, they have similar
expectations of others.</p>
<p>With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJ’s focus their energy on
observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers
information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously insightful and
usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not
understanding a concept, but rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the
INTP, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it
fully. INTJ’s are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and
organization usually requires that they take some action.</p>
<p>INTJ's tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with their
natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. An INTJ scientist gives a gift to
society by putting their ideas into a useful form for others to follow. It is not easy for the
INTJ to express their internal images, insights, and abstractions. The internal form of the
INTJ's thoughts and concepts is highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into
a form that others will understand. However, the INTJ is driven to translate their ideas
into a plan or system that is usually readily explainable, rather than to do a direct
translation of their thoughts. They usually don't see the value of a direct transaction, and
will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear. However, their
extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will motivate them to explain themselves
to another person who they feel is deserving of the effort.</p>
<p>INTJ’s are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background
until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are
quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are
adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well. They are the supreme
strategists - always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against
their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency.</p><p>INTJ’s spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest in the other
people's thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have
problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed. Unless their Sensing
side is developed, they may have a tendency to ignore details which are necessary for
implementing their ideas.</p>
<p>The INTJ's interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express judgments,
and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and rational system.
Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they have very evolved
intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about things. Unless they complement
their intuitive understanding with a well-developed ability to express their insights, they
may find themselves frequently misunderstood. In these cases, INTJ’s tend to blame
misunderstandings on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty
in expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the INTJ to dismiss others input too
quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist.</p>
<p>INTJ’s are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many INTJ’s end
up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough challenge within the
business world in areas which involve organizing and strategic planning. They dislike
messiness and inefficiency, and anything that is muddled or unclear. They value clarity
and efficiency, and will put enormous amounts of energy and time into consolidating
their insights into structured patterns.
Other people may have a difficult time understanding an INTJ. They may see them as
aloof and reserved. Indeed, the INTJ is not overly demonstrative of their affections, and
is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as others may need or desire. That
doesn't mean that he or she doesn't truly have affection or regard for others, they simply
do not typically feel the need to express it. Others may falsely perceive the INTJ as being
rigid and set in their ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the INTJ is
committed to always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas.</p> <p>The
INTJ is usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something.
When under a great deal of stress, the INTJ may become obsessed with mindless
repetitive, sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to become
absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider important to
their overall goal.</p>
<p>INTJ’s need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid difficulties
with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly developing their
communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with people, and
isolationists.</p>
<p>INTJ’s have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have
insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into solid plans of
action. Their reasoning skills give them the means to accomplish that. INTJ’s are most
always highly competent people, and will not have a problem meeting their career oreducation goals. They have the capability to make great strides in these arenas. On a
personal level, the INTJ who practices tolerances and puts effort into effectively
communicating their insights to others has everything in his or her power to lead a rich
and rewarding life.</p>
